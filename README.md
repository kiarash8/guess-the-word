# GUESS THE WORD!

Guess The Word is a word guessing game ([Demo](https://kiarash8.github.io/guess-the-word/)). I created this because I wanted to show a quick example of using components-based design, and some of my opinions about how the project structure should look.

### Game Rules

- You only be able to use any characters between a-z or A-Z.
- The word must be in between 1 and 12 letters.
- You have 3 guesses to guess the correct word.
- After submitting a guess, you'll see the matched letters count.

### Packages

- `next`, `react`, `react-dom`, `typescript`
- `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, `clsx`
